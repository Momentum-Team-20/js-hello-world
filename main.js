// Intro JS exercise
console.log('oh hai! Welcome to the console!')
console.log(
  "You can write and run JavaScript directly here. It's like a scratchpad for your code."
)
console.log('You can also log any output from your JavaScript files here.')

// Read carefully and uncomment the necessary lines one at a time as you run the code.

// 1. What does `firstName` evaluate to on the following lines?
// Uncomment the following lines and reload the page in the browser to find out.
// let firstName = 'Jamal'
// console.log('The firstName variable evaluates to ', firstName)

// 2. We can reassign values to existing variables. Here we are reassigning the a new string to the `firstName` variable.
// Uncomment the following lines to run the code, and look in the console to see the output.
// firstName = "Avery"
// console.log("The firstName variable now has an assigned value of ", firstName)

// 3. We can assign the value of one variable to another variable.
// Uncomment the following lines to run the code, and look in the console to see the output:
// let name = firstName
// console.log("The name variable evaluates to ", name)

// 4. Now you try assigning a value to a variable.
// Assign a value to the `greeting` variable that is a string. It could be anything, like "Hi" or "What's up" or "Guten tag".
// Then, write another line for your console.log statement that will log the variable to the console.
// let greeting

// 5. We can combine the `greeting` and `name` variables to output a personalized greeting. Uncomment and check the console.
// console.log(greeting + ", " + name + "!")

// 6. We can do math with variables, too. What does `result` evaluate to in the following lines?
// Read the following code and make a prediction about what you think the value of `result` will be.
// Uncomment the following lines and check the console to verify what value is store in the variable `result`
// let score1 = 50
// let score2  = 10
// let result = score1 - score2
// console.log("Result is:", result)

// 7. JavaScript will try to convert strings to numbers when doing math.
// Predict what `result` will return here. Then uncomment the following lines and check the console to verify.

// result = score1 - "5"

// 8. Create a variable to calculate the total number of tacos and burritos.
// Log a sentence that tells the user the total number.
// Uncomment the following lines and then write your code:
// let tacos = 8
// let burritos = 4
// write your code here
// don't forget to log to the console
