# Hello, World!
## JS Edition

The main.js file contains examples of expressions that you can output to the console using `console.log`.

To get started, open index.html in the browser, open the dev tools and click on the console tab.

In your code editor, open `main.js` and work on the exercises in there. You'll need to uncomment the necessary lines as you work your way through each numbered exercise and run each one.
